## Description

This program retrieves historical and current prices of cryptocurrencies from Coinbase and generates Simple Moving Average (SMA) values for a set of day ranges (e.g. SMA200, SMA50). The values are then uploaded to a Google Sheet where conditional formatting is used to color the values in order to give an impression of how "hot" or "cold" the current price is in relation to a given SMA day range.
